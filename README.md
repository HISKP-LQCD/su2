# A MCMC sampling package for lattice gauge theories

This package implements Metropolis Monte Carlo and Hybrid Monte Carlo for SU(2) and U(1) gauge theories.

To compile, type

```
./init-cmake-build.sh
```

in the source directory. 

There are several executables being build. Invoking them with the `-h` option will give instructions on command line parameters.
