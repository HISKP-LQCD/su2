# Conjugate Gradient

In this folder is implemented an example of how to use the Conjugate Gradient (CG).

The library, ```../cg.hpp```, is of general purpose. The user can define matrix and vector containers with the desired parallelizations and optimizations.

The file ```LA.hpp``` defines matrix and vector operations.
The file cg.cpp shows how to use the CG using the latter types.
