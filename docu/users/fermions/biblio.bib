abstract = {In this paper we study the properties of the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm applied to lattice quantum chromodynamics including the dynamical effects of fermions. We find that this “exact” method performs very well on 44 lattices, and shows considerable promise for being a practicable means with which to undertake realistic Monte Carlo computations of fermionic systems.}
